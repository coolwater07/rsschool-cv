### About myself

I work as an IT consultant with Infor software, but I'd like to get a more demanded profession in the IT field, to be able to develop not only in one area. So I first started learning HTML / CSS / JS on my own on YouTube. Later I found out about RS School and decided to try to study. The course on JavaScript / Front-end started for the first time, I did not have enough skills to finish). I hope this time the attempt will be crowned with success, and I'll acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for myself.
