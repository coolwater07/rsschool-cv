### About myself

I work as an IT consultant with Infor software, but I'd like to get a more demanded profession in the IT field, to be able to develop not only in one area. So I first started learning HTML / CSS / JS on my own on YouTube. Later I found out about RS School and decided to try to study. The course on JavaScript / Front-end started for the first time, I did not have enough skills to finish). I hope this time the attempt will be crowned with success, and I will acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for myself.

### Skills
I have a basic knowledge of Oracle SQL, HTML / CSS, started learning JS

### Code example

function ablink() {
if (b==1) {
 document.forms[0].abutton.value = stringm[a]
   b-- ;
    a++;
  if (a>4) {a = 1};}
else {
 document.forms[0].abutton.value = "";
   b++ }
}
